How to work on this project

Step 1: Collect Gesture Data
Run the script and follow prompts to collect 30 video sequences for each gesture:

python collected_data.py

Data will be stored in the Data_collection/ folder automatically.

Step 2: Train the Model

python train_model.py

This trains the LSTM model and saves it as action.h5. Accuracy/loss plots and a confusion matrix will be shown.

Step 3: Run Real-Time Detection (CLI) for testing
